Hello fellow validators!!  

B-Harvest has created `Proposal 27` for a new community consumer chain, Crescent: `goc-crescent`.
The voting is live for Crescent chain, and it is scheduled to start on 1 December 2022!

Kindly help us to launch Crescent by voting:

One more favor, please vote "No" for Proposal 26, I wrote wrong url for our git repo.
